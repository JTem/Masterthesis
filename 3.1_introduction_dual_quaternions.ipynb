    "Similarly to <i>Homogeneours Transformation Matrices</i>, which are part of the <i>Special Euclidean Group</i> $SE(3)$, dual quaternions can be used to represent spatial transformations. dual quaternions used for spatial transformations are called <strong>unit dual quaternions</strong>. Here, the real part of the dual quaternion $Re(\\underline{\\xi}) =  \\underline{\\xi}_r = q_r$ is a unit quaternion, which represents the orientation and rotation of the dual quaternion transformation. The dual part $Du(\\underline{\\xi}) =  \\underline{\\xi}_d = q_d$ is not required to satisfy the unit magnitude requirement, as it represents the translation of the transformation. <br>\n",
