    "This thesis has extensively explored the transformative impact of collaborative robots (cobots) on the manufacturing industry, particularly within the context of Industry 4.0. Cobots, characterized by their flexibility, ease of programming, and safety in close proximity to human workers, represent a significant shift in the landscape of robotic applications in manufacturing. Their ability to adapt to small and medium-sized production lines and their affordability make them particularly suitable for businesses not traditionally employing robotic solutions. The predicted market growth of cobots, with a compound annual growth rate of 34.3% until 2029, underscores their rising significance in modern manufacturing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key focus of this research has been on the efficient and reliable trajectory tracking in cobots, a critical aspect for both performance and safety in various applications. The study highlighted the unique challenges posed by redundant cobots, especially those with seven degrees of freedom and anthropomorphic arm designs. These challenges stem from the complexities associated with the extra degree of freedom, which, while enhancing flexibility and dexterity, introduce difficulties in trajectory tracking due to potential singularities and limited dexterity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a detailed analysis, this thesis has identified two major types of singularities – representative and kinematic – that pose significant risks in robotic systems. These singularities can lead to problems such as high joint velocities, unpredictable motion, and loss of control, all of which are detrimental to safety and task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, this research proposed a novel algorithm that leverages predictive singularity avoidance and the mathematical properties of Dual Quaternions. The algorithm's predictive capabilities allow for the early detection of potential singular configurations, enabling proactive optimization of the cobot's joint configuration. This approach not only avoids singularities but also optimizes other key performance metrics such as distance from joint limits, collision avoidance, energy efficiency, and joint speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the research presented in this thesis contributes significantly to the field of robotics, particularly in the application of cobots in manufacturing. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a robust solution to the challenges of trajectory tracking in redundant robotic systems, paving the way for safer, more efficient, and flexible robotic applications in various industrial scenarios. The growing prevalence of cobots in the industry, coupled with the advancements in trajectory tracking and singularity avoidance presented in this work, heralds a new era of collaborative robotics where human and robot can work side by side with enhanced safety, efficiency, and synergy."
