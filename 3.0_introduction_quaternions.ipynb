    "Hamilton introduced quaternions in the nineteenth century which can be viewed as an extension of the complex number theory. Instead of only one imaginary unit as for a complex number, quaternions are defined with three imaginary components $i$, $j$, and $k$, which possess the following properties <cite id=\"lunr8\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FH9XC4M77\">(Hamilton, 1844)</a></cite>:\n",

Their ability to interpolate between orientations <cite id=\"ndpzf\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FM23ULJLX\">(Shoemake, 1985)</a></cite> and the ease with which they handle compound rotations make them indispensable in modern robotics.\n",

The most common is the vector notation, where the complex part of the quaternion is condensed into the so-called <i>complex vector</i> $\\vec{v} = (x, y, z)$.

This characteristic allows unit quaternions to represent orientations and rotations as they lose their ability to scale. This is analog to the fact that the determinant of a rotation matrix is one. Another analogy is that the concatenation of Quaternions is not commutative, which means that the order of multiplication matters to the final orientation\n",

    "From the interactive plot it is clearly visible that both quaternions start and end in the same orientation, but take different paths to reach this point. The rotation $q_{start} \\to q_{target}$ takes she shortest path around the aperent, constant rotation axis, where as $q_{start} \\to -q_{target}$ takes the long path to reach the target orientation. It can be explained by the fact that a negative rotation around the inverted rotation axis yields the same orientation as a positive orientation around the normal rotation axis, i.e $\\theta \\tilde{r} = (-\\theta)(-\\tilde{r})$, which means that the quaternions $q_{target}$ and $-q_{target}$ lie on different hemispheres on the hypersphere surface $\\mathcal{S}^3.$ This property is unique to unit quaternions and can be leveraged in robotic motion-planning, for more complex and dexterous motions.\n",

      "abstract": "This paper is written to aid the readers to understand application of Euler angles and quaternion in representing rotation of a body in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, ℜ3 . Application of quaternion would later require conversion of the quaternion to Euler angles. This is to enable quaternion to be compatible with other applications which use Euler rotation sequence to represent rotation. Thus, a framework to convert a quaternion, which is produced from a random rotation sequence to Euler angles with any specified rotation sequence is proposed and demonstrated here, to aid practitioners to use quaternion in their applications. This will also enable quaternion to be applied in arbitrary sequence onto applications developed using certain rotation sequence of Euler angles. Finally, a program is developed using Matlab-simulink software to demonstrate application of quaternion in maneuvering orientation of a missile flying in 3D space. Six degree of freedom (6DoF) block, which employs Euler rotation sequence of XYZ, is used to aid users to graphically see the maneuvering of the missile’s orientation as it flies in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Quaternion, which is produced from random rotation sequence keyed in by the user, is converted to Euler angles with rotation sequence XYZ by using the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.",

      "abstract": "The main topic addressed in this paper is a comparison between Euler parametrization and Quaternion one in the description of the dynamics of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle assumed as a rigid body. In details Newton Euler equations are re-written in terms of quaternions due to the singularities that the Euler angles lead. This formulation not only avoids the gimbal lock but also allows a better performance in numerical implementation thanks to the linearity of quaternion algebra. This kind of analysis, proved by some numerical results presented, has a great importance due to the applicability of quaternion to drone control. Indeed, this latter requires a time response as quick as possible, in order to be reliable.",
