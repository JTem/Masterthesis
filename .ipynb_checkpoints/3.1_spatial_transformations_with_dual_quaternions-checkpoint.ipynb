    "A well known approach to express coupled rotational and translational transformations is by employing screw theory, which is well explained by <cite id=\"io4em\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FUIFPWU6T\">(Lynch &#38; Park, 2017)</a></cite>. The main concept of a screw displacement can be seen in the code example that shows a screw motion around an adjustable screw. Similar to the exponential mapping of axis angle parameters $\\theta \\tilde{r}$ to compute the unit quaternions representing orientation, it is possible to express screw-based coupled transformations with the exponential mapping of screw axis. This characteristic of dual quaternions to inherit the properties related to quaternions has been referred to as the <i>principle of transference</i> [41, 20, 9]. Another property that unit dual quaternions inherit from unit quaternions include the double cover of $\\mathcal{SE}(3)$. We have exploited these properties in our implementation to deal with challanges imposed by classical methods.\n",

Here, $ \\vec{m} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 $ is called the moment vector, computed from the position of the screw axis relative to the reference frame $\\vec{p}$ and the rotation axis $ \\tilde{r} $ as $ \\vec{m} = \\vec{p} \\times \\tilde{r}.$ The screw axis $\\vec{s} \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$ is then defined as a combination of the rotation axis and the moment: \n",

This relation is later used for the interpolation in dualquaternion space and for the differential kinematics as it allows to represent cartesian velocities in the dual quaternion space $\\mathbb{H}$. For a complete algorithm the acceleration is also computed. The derivation is similar to the fist derivative, the translational and angular accelerations $\\ddot{\\bar{t}}$ and $\\dot{\\omega}$ are given and the quaternion derivative $\\dot{\\hat{q}}$ is again substituted with formula X.

      "abstract": "Modern approaches for robot kinematics employ the product of exponentials formulation, represented using homogeneous transformation matrices. Quaternions over dual numbers are an established alternative representation; however, their use presents certain challenges: the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm contain a zero-angle singularity, and many common operations are less efficient using dual quaternions than with matrices. We present a new derivation of the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm that removes the singularity, we show an implicit representation of dual quaternions offers analytical and empirical efficiency advantages compared with both matrices and explicit dual quaternions, and we derive efficient dual quaternion forms of differential and inverse position kinematics. Analytically, implicit dual quaternions are more compact and require fewer arithmetic instructions for common operations, including chaining and exponentials. Empirically, we demonstrate a 30â€“40% speedup on forward kinematics and a 300â€“500% speedup on inverse position kinematics. This work relates dual quaternions with modern exponential coordinates and demonstrates that dual quaternions are a robust and efficient representation for robot kinematics.",
