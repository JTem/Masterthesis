    "Hamilton introduced quaternions in the nineteenth century which can be viewed as an extension of the complex number theory. Instead of only one imaginary unit as for a complex number, quaternions are defined with three imaginary components $i$, $j$, and $k$, which possess the following properties <cite id=\"lunr8\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FH9XC4M77\">(Hamilton, 1844)</a></cite>:\n",

    "\n",
    "A quaternion must be unit length to represent orientation and rotation, which is a benefit over the orientation representation with rotation matrices, meaning $\\|\\hat{q}\\| = 1$. The euclidean norm of a unit quaternion is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|\\hat{q}\\| = \\sqrt{q_w^2 + q_x^2 + q_y^2 + q_z^2}.\n",

    "Quaternions with unit length are called <strong>Unit Quaternions</strong> and can be thought of as points on the unit four-dimensional hypersphere surface, which spans the curved space of $\\mathcal{S}^3$. This characteristic allows unit quaternions to represent orientations and rotations as they lose their ability to scale. This is analog to the fact that the determinant of a rotation matrix is one. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use Quaternions for Orientation representation, most commonly the axis angle representation of rotation / orientation is used. Here a unit quaternion $\\hat{q} \\in \\mathcal{S}^3$ is associated with $\\theta \\tilde{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and can be derived via the so called <i>exponential map</i> as,\n",

    "For this intuitive way to describe rotation, the angle $\\theta$ describes the rotation angle around the unit-length rotation axis $\\tilde{r}$. The exponential map is a <i>Lie Theoretic</i> concept and can be further studied with great detail in the excellent work <cite id=\"kt1h8\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FGF7XZFAM\">(Shahidi, 2023)</a></cite>. Delving too deep into the mathematical foundations of lie theory and Clifford algebra would exceed the scope of this Thesis, only the later used operations are introduced and shown to generate a natural understanding of the key concepts used later. <br>\n",
    "In practice $\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r}$ is often not given seperately as required by above definition, meaning that both angle and rotation axis are not given independently to the constructer, but is given as single vector $\\vec{w} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, which requires another definition of the exponential map constructor.\n",

    "This computation is analog but here, the half angle $\\frac{\\theta}{2}$ has to be extracted via computation of the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{w}$ and the rotation axis $\\tilde{r} = \\frac{\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}$ has to be found via renormalization of the exponent $\\vec{w}$. This contemplation leads to the introduction of a singularity, in case of $\\|\\vec{w}\\| = 0$, which is called zero-angle singularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse mapping $\\mathcal{S}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ is called the <i>logarithmic map</i>. This operation extracts the axis angle $\\vec{w} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r}$ from any unit quaternion $\\hat{q} = (q_w, \\vec{v})$ and is defined as:\n",

To handle these singularites, the maclaurin series expansions can be extended and reformulated shown in <cite id=\"ku8rr\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FAFEHQ7QJ\">(Dantam, 2021)</a></cite>. This singulary handling can also be seen in the implementation of the quaternion python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both exponential and logarithmic map are very useful as they give a direct mapping between the curved $\\mathcal{S}^3$ and the flat $\\mathbb{R}^3$ space, which simplifies many computations needed in robotics. Besides that the axis angle rotation representation of $\\vec{w} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r}$ is physically meaningfull and can be used to compute the orientation error for inverse kinematics computation later.\n",
    "\n",

    "From the interactive plot it is clearly visible that both quaternions start and end in the same orientation, but take different paths to reach this point. The rotation $\\hat{q}_{start} \\to \\hat{q}_{target}$ takes she shortest path around the aperent, constant rotation axis, where as $\\hat{q}_{start} \\to -\\hat{q}_{target}$ takes the long path to reach the target orientation. It can be explained by the fact that a negative rotation around the inverted rotation axis yields the same orientation as a positive orientation around the normal rotation axis, i.e $\\theta \\tilde{r} = (-\\theta)(-\\tilde{r})$, which means that the quaternions $\\hat{q}_{target}$ and $-\\hat{q}_{target}$ lie on different hemispheres on the hypersphere surface $\\mathcal{S}^3.$ This property is unique to unit quaternions and can be leveraged in robotic motion-planning, for more complex and dexterous motions.\n",

    "Pure Quaternions, denoted by a vertical bar $\\bar{\\bullet}$, are characterized by the absence of the real part. The pure quaternions complex part, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^3$, is then used to represent any vector $\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. <br>\n",
    "In mathematical terms, a pure quaternion $\\bar{p}$ is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "To rotate a point (or vector) $\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ in three dimensional space with quaternions, the vector has to be represented as pure quaternion, relative to the frame it is defined in.

    "Rotation matrices are most commonly used in robotics to describe spatial orientation. They are widely recognized for their intuitive structure and straightforward implementation. Rotation matrices are part of the special orthogonal group $\\mathcal{SO}(3)$ and can be divided into two sub categories <cite id=\"u68lm\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2F98FQA85Y\">(Hashim, 2019)</a></cite>:\n",

    "    <li><strong>Euler Angles</strong>: All rotation matrices constructed by three subsequent basis rotations are part of the euler angle category. These rotations take part around the basis axes of the aparent coordinate system X, Y, Z. They are a minimal representation as they only require three parameters to define a rotatation. All three parameter representations of $\\mathcal{SO}(3)$ are proven to suffer from the well known gimbal lock singularity <cite id=\"kzisx\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FTPTTZSUA\">(Stuelpnagel, 1964)</a></cite>.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Axis Angle</strong>: Construction of Rotation matrices with the <i>Rodriguez Formula</i> are similar to quaternions in the way that they are described as axis angle rotation. They are a four parameter representation and do not suffer from gimbal lock, but in contrary to quaternions they do not have the antipodal property, thus lack information content when compared to quaernions.

    "To show the singularity robustness on a practical example, we construct an orientation quaternion $\\hat{q}_{RPY} = \\hat{q}_x \\otimes \\hat{q}_y \\otimes \\hat{q}_z$ with Euler angles XYZ convention, called Roll-Pitch-Yaw. By setting the pitch angle close to $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi$, the loss of a degree of freedom in the rotation can be observed. To give more insight into the singularity problems that arise from the computation with euler angles, we do the inverse operation to retrieve the euler angles back from the rotation matrix $R(\\hat{q}_{RPY})$, and do the same to retrieve the axis angle information $\\vec{w} = \\log(\\hat{q}_{RPY})$.

    "The example shows that the RPY-inverse operation is not useful for a robotic controller. The motion range of $(-2\\pi, 2\\pi)$ is very common for cobots and causes the inverse rpy-angle computation to jump due to the multiply singularities of gimbal lock and the extension of the usual rotation matrix interval. To the contrary, the quaternion logarithm is always well defined without taking special care as quaternions are simply singularity free and well defined on the typical motion range of a modern serial manipulator.\n",

      "abstract": "This paper is written to aid the readers to understand application of Euler angles and quaternion in representing rotation of a body in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, ℜ3 . Application of quaternion would later require conversion of the quaternion to Euler angles. This is to enable quaternion to be compatible with other applications which use Euler rotation sequence to represent rotation. Thus, a framework to convert a quaternion, which is produced from a random rotation sequence to Euler angles with any specified rotation sequence is proposed and demonstrated here, to aid practitioners to use quaternion in their applications. This will also enable quaternion to be applied in arbitrary sequence onto applications developed using certain rotation sequence of Euler angles. Finally, a program is developed using Matlab-simulink software to demonstrate application of quaternion in maneuvering orientation of a missile flying in 3D space. Six degree of freedom (6DoF) block, which employs Euler rotation sequence of XYZ, is used to aid users to graphically see the maneuvering of the missile’s orientation as it flies in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Quaternion, which is produced from random rotation sequence keyed in by the user, is converted to Euler angles with rotation sequence XYZ by using the proposed method.",

Quaternions over dual numbers are an established alternative representation; however, their use presents certain challenges: the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm contain a zero-angle singularity, and many common operations are less efficient using dual quaternions than with matrices. We present a new derivation of the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm that removes the singularity, we show an implicit representation of dual quaternions offers analytical and empirical efficiency advantages compared with both matrices and explicit dual quaternions, and we derive efficient dual quaternion forms of differential and inverse position kinematics. Analytically, implicit dual quaternions are more compact and require fewer arithmetic instructions for common operations, including chaining and exponentials. Empirically, we demonstrate a 30–40% speedup on forward kinematics and a 300–500% speedup on inverse position kinematics. This work relates dual quaternions with modern exponential coordinates and demonstrates that dual quaternions are a robust and efficient representation for robot kinematics.",

      "abstract": "The cooperation of several mobile and stationary robots in consensus is considered as one of the most important enablers for efficient, agile, and freely networked assembly systems. In this sense, the dynamic transformation of production lines requires especial modelling and control strategies for robotic manipulators, in order to provide them with reliable and feasible motions that are efficiently optimal. Therefore, the essential differences of the systems' models should be considered individually when planning their motions. At the same time, the modelling of the system should provide the control systems with an intuitive and unambiguous framework to guide them optimally through the planned motion.In the present work, optimal modelling strategies for multibody systems with tree-topology, of which open-chain robotic manipulators can be considered as a subcategory, are discussed and developed. The optimality of a modelling strategy is understood as computational efficiency, singularity-free representation, and compactness. To this end, a unit dual quaternionic representation of the system's configuration is presented and comprehensively discussed. Based on this representation, the geometry, kinetostatics, and dynamics of the multibody systems with tree-topology are developed. In order to facilitate the modelling and achieve an intuitive formulation, the geometric framework of screw theory is discussed on the analytical basis of Lie theory. This foundation can be employed to model control strategies that fulfil the premises of reliable and efficient motion control.In order to enable efficient motion planning for open-chain robotic manipulators, the essential differences between the cardinalities of their configuration manifold and their work space are considered, leading to the construction of a data structure in the form of a graph, dubbed Kinematic Graph. Using this graph, it is possible to efficiently apply the well-developed motion planning Algorithms, such as the sampling-based motion planning Algorithm, in the case study of robotic manipulators with open chains. These Algorithms were originally developed for low dimensional problems and are generally not suitable for the case study of robotic manipulators. Such Algorithms allow the application of planning strategies with theoretical optimality guarantees in the planning. This leads to the planning of an efficiently optimal motion for open-chain robotic manipulators with decoupled geometry, where the planning for the regional and the local structures should be conducted in conjunction with each other. Developments already exist for these optimal Algorithms to solve problems where conditions (such as the environment) are subject to change. The enabled application of these Algorithms to robotic manipulators makes it possible to plan motion for such systems in dynamic situations.",

The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.",

      "abstract": "The main topic addressed in this paper is a comparison between Euler parametrization and Quaternion one in the description of the dynamics of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle assumed as a rigid body. In details Newton Euler equations are re-written in terms of quaternions due to the singularities that the Euler angles lead. This formulation not only avoids the gimbal lock but also allows a better performance in numerical implementation thanks to the linearity of quaternion algebra. This kind of analysis, proved by some numerical results presented, has a great importance due to the applicability of quaternion to drone control. Indeed, this latter requires a time response as quick as possible, in order to be reliable.",
