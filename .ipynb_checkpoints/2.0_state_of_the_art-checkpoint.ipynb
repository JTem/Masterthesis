    "# State of the Art\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will cover the State of the art of current common solutions for trajectory tracking of redundant robots.It will show the state of the Art of Forward Kinematics, Differential Kinematics and the application of the differential kinematics to redundant robots. In the end of this chapter the application of Dual Quaternions to both problems and currently available literature is discussed and a comparison of the current state of the art will be shown, depicting the lack of robust sinularity handling during robot trajectory tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "At the base of each robotic systems the Forward Kinematic Convetion has to be chosen. Here, three common types can be found in literature, the well know Denevit-Hartenberg-Convention (DH-Convention) <cite id=\"dtv7r\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2F42TNDPMV\">(Denavit &#38; Hartenberg, 1955)</a></cite> and its abbreviations like modified-DH <cite id=\"cxdpo\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FW8EF482S\">(A Chennakesava Reddy, 2014)</a></cite>, the matrix exponential approach which was made popular by Lynch and Park <cite id=\"8adyb\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FUIFPWU6T\">(Lynch &#38; Park, 2017)</a></cite> and the Elemental Transform Sequence (ETS) approach which was introduced by Jesse Haviland and Peter Corke <cite id=\"0yeem\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FWHL4UY7J\">(Haviland &#38; Corke, 2020)</a></cite>. \n",
    "These methods will be briefly introduced and compared. An extension to dual quaternions will also be discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention\n",
    "The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention is a standardized and minimal representative method to express the kinematic geometry of robotic arms. This approach simplifies the complex kinematic structure of a robot into a series of simple transformations. Each joint and link of the robot is represented by four parameters: link length, link twist, link offset, and joint angle. These parameters define the transformation from one link to the next. The DH Convention has been widely adopted due to its systematic approach, allowing for a structured and simplified, yet restrictive representation of the robot's kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Exponential Approach\n",
    "Moving beyond the traditional DH Convention, the matrix exponential approach offers a more versatile representation of kinematics. It is grounded in the concept of Lie groups and Lie algebras, where the kinematics are expressed in terms of exponential coordinates. This method is particularly effective in handling the kinematics of complex robotic systems, including those with closed chains and singular configurations. The matrix exponential approach provides a compact and elegant way to represent the kinematic equations, facilitating efficient computation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elemental Transform Sequence\n",
    "The Elemental Transform Sequence is a modern approach that offers an alternative to the DH method. ETS breaks down the kinematics into a series of elementary transformations, which can be easily understood and visualized. This method provides a more intuitive way of representing robot kinematics, especially for those with complex or unconventional structures. Unlike the DH method, ETS does not impose a fixed order of transformations, granting more flexibility in defining the kinematic chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inverse Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a fundamental aspect of robotic control, central to the translation of desired end-effector positions and orientations into the necessary joint configurations. This subchapter explores the state of the Art of IK methodologies, from early analytical techniques to the contemporary landscape dominated by inverse differential kinematics, underscoring the pivotal advancements and diverse approaches that have shaped this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytical/Geometric Inverse Kinematics\n",
    "For simpler robotic systems a lot of literature describes the IK problem if often solved using geometric or algebraic methods on position level <cite id=\"zu78w\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FJTQ8HGEP\">(Sun et al., 2017)</a></cite>, <cite id=\"pblwl\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FPSIMY75M\">(Wang et al., 2018)</a></cite>. These methods, while intuitive, are limited in scope and applicability, especially as robotic systems grew in complexity and the task requirements grew. Finding robust solutions for redundant robots is possible but the complexity of defining extra conditions grows exponentially as redundant robots often have infinite IK solutions in the case they are not singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fullfill these growing requirements, numerical methods have been derived, which are applicable for a variety of cobots, and dont have the requirements of intersecting / parallel axis, which is allows to find the IK solution for calibrated robots. These features give numerical methods a high value in industrial application, given their ease of use and their ability to fullfill the high accuracy requirements of modern applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical Inverse Kinematics\n",
    "To fullfill the growing requirements, numerical methods have been derived, particularly iterative techniques that use the Jacobian matrix to progressively converge to the desired end-effector position <cite id=\"x7lov\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FBPUMZXI3\">(Goldenberg et al., 1985)</a></cite>. These methods are generalizable and applicable to a broad range cobots, and do not have the requirement of intersecting axis, which are common in geometric/analytical approaches, allowing to also find the IK solution for calibrated robots. These features give numerical methods a high value in industrial applications, given their ease of use and their ability to fullfill the high requirements in accuracy and flexibility of modern applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization algorithms emerged as another powerful tool, framing the IK problem as an optimization task. This perspective allowed for the minimization of errors between the desired and actual end-effector positions, further expanding the utility of IK in complex robotic applications, as these methods offer the easy integration of boundary conditions and extra optimization critera. A common IK based on optimization is the well known TRAC-IK library <cite id=\"9xuo9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FCX5ZL77E\">(Beeson &#38; Ames, 2015)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse Differential Kinematics\n",
    "Inverse differential kinematics are based on the same concepts as the iterative IK algorithms. Instead of iteratively reducing the error between the current end-effector and the desired end-effektor position, the inverse differential kinematics shifts the focus to the robot's velocity level, computing the desired joint velocities based on the desired endeffektor velocity. Differential Kinematics are vital for dynamic tasks requiring real-time solutions. This method's integration into control systems has been instrumental in achieving smoother and more responsive robot movements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redundant Cobots\n",
    "The issue of redundancy, particularly prevalent in robots with extra DoFs, brought additional challenges. Multiple solutions to the IK problem necessitated the development of strategies to identify optimal joint configurations, often prioritizing factors such as energy efficiency, manipulability or obstacle avoidance."

    "#### Extension to Dual Quaternions\n",
    "Dual quaternions extend the concept of quaternions from representing rotations to representing both rotations and translations in 3D space. This extension is particularly beneficial for expressing the kinematics of robotic systems. Dual quaternions offer a compact, non-singular representation for 3D transformations, providing advantages in computational efficiency and numerical stability. When integrated with forward kinematics, dual quaternions allow for a more robust and efficient handling of robot motions, especially in 3D space where rotations and translations are intertwined. This approach is gaining popularity in advanced robotic applications, such as those involving 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) manipulators, where precision and computational efficiency are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the advancement from traditional DH Convention to modern approaches like matrix exponential, ETS, and the incorporation of dual quaternions, demonstrates the continuous evolution in the field of robot kinematics. These methodologies offer diverse ways to approach complex kinematic problems, each with its own set of advantages, catering to the specific needs of various robotic applications."

      "abstract": "The elementary transform sequence (ETS) provides a universal method of describing the kinematics of any serial-link manipulator. The ETS notation is intuitive and easy to understand, while avoiding the complexity and limitations of Denvit-Hartenberg frame assignment. In this paper, we describe a systematic method for computing the manipulator Jacobian and Hessian (differential kinematics) using the ETS notation. Differential kinematics have many applications including numerical inverse kinematics, resolved-rate motion control and manipulability motion control. Furthermore, we provide an open-source Python library which implements our algorithm and can be interfaced with any serial-link manipulator (available at github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python).",
