Each imaginary unit of a quaternion, denoted as <em>i, j,</em> and <em>k</em>, squares to -1, much like the imaginary unit in complex numbers. The rules governing quaternion multiplication are distinct, though, with each pair of imaginary units following specific multiplication rules: <em>ij = k, jk = i, ki = j</em>, and cyclic permutations thereof. This non-commutative nature of quaternion multiplication is crucial in accurately representing 3D rotational dynamics.\n",
