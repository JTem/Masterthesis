    "\n",
    "This section aims to give insight into some mathematical foundations used throughout the thesis. More specifically, it presents the main concepts and operations of quaternions, which are later extended to unit dual quaternions to use the benefits of quaternions in the realm of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton introduced quaternions in the nineteenth century, which can be viewed as an extension of the complex number theory. Instead of only one imaginary unit as for a complex number, quaternions are defined with three imaginary components $i$, $j$, and $k$, which possess the following properties <cite id=\"lunr8\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FH9XC4M77\">(Hamilton, 1844)</a></cite>:\n",

    "i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When discovered by Hamilton, quaternions were just a theoretical concept. However, in recent years they have been broadly used to represent both orientation and rotation in three-dimensional space due to their advantages over classical Euler angle representations <cite id=\"9zmqf\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2F7MLS2H2W\">(Perumal, 2011)</a></cite>, <cite id=\"rbr1d\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FZV86QVV9\">(Alaimo et al., 2013)</a></cite>. Unlike traditional vector rotations that suffer from issues like gimbal lock, quaternions offer a robust and efficient way to represent spatial orientations and rotations. Their ability to interpolate between orientations <cite id=\"ndpzf\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FM23ULJLX\">(Shoemake, 1985)</a></cite> and the ease with which they handle compound rotations make them indispensable in modern robotics.\n",

Different notations are common and used throughout the thesis. The most common is the vector notation, where the complex part of the quaternion is condensed into the so-called <i>complex vector</i> $\\vec{v} = Im(q) = (q_x, q_y, q_z)$.

    "\n",
    "A quaternion must be unit length to represent orientation and rotation, meaning $\\|\\hat{q}\\| = 1$. The unit length property is denoted by $\\hat{\\bullet}$. The Euclidean norm of a quaternion is defined as: \n",

    "\\|\\hat{q}\\| = \\sqrt{q_w^2 + q_x^2 + q_y^2 + q_z^2}.\n",

    "\n",
    "Quaternions with unit length are called <strong>Unit Quaternions</strong> and can be thought of as points on the unit four-dimensional hypersphere surface, which spans the curved space of $\\mathcal{S}^3$. This characteristic allows unit quaternions to represent orientations and rotations as they lose their ability to scale. The unit length characteristic is analog to the fact that the determinant of a rotation matrix is one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions for orientation representation most commonly use the axis angle representation of rotation/orientation. Here, a unit quaternion $\\hat{q} \\in \\mathcal{S}^3$ is associated with $\\theta \\tilde{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and can be derived via the so-called <i>exponential map</i> as,\n",

Delving too deep into the mathematical foundations of Lie theory and Clifford algebra would exceed the scope of this thesis. Only the operations that are used later throughout the thesis are introduced and shown to generate a natural understanding of the key concepts used later. <br>\n",
    "In practice, $\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r}$ is often not given separately as required by the above definition, meaning that both angle and rotation axis are not given independently to the constructer but are given as single vector $\\vec{w} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, which requires another definition of the exponential map constructor.\n",

This contemplation leads to the introduction of a singularity, in the case of $\\|\\vec{w}\\| = 0$, which is called <i>zero-angle singularity</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse mapping $\\mathcal{S}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ is called the <i>logarithmic map</i>. This operation extracts the axis angle $\\vec{w} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r}$ from any unit quaternion $\\hat{q} = (q_w, \\vec{v})$ and is defined as:\n",

    "Again, a zero-angle singularity can be seen in case the vector part of the quaternion has no magnitude. To handle these singularities, the Maclaurin series expansions can be extended and reformulated as shown in <cite id=\"col8e\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FAFEHQ7QJ\">(Dantam, 2021)</a></cite>. This singularity handling can also be seen in the implementation of the quaternion Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both exponential and logarithmic maps are useful as they give a direct mapping between the curved $\\mathcal{S}^3$ and the flat $\\mathbb{R}^3$ space, which simplifies many computations needed in robotics. Besides that, the axis angle rotation representation of $\\vec{w} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\tilde{r}$ is physically meaningful and can be used to compute the orientation error for inverse kinematics computation later.\n",

    "An interactive code example is given to explain the exponential mapping in more detail. Here, a rotation axis can be manipulated, and a coordinate system, subsequently called <i>frame</i> can be rotated around the rotation axis $\\tilde{r}$ via the setting of an angle $\\theta$."

    "The interactive plot shows that both quaternions start and end in the same orientation but take different paths to reach this point. The rotation $\\hat{q}_{start} \\to \\hat{q}_{target}$ takes the shortest path around the apparent, constant rotation axis, whereas $\\hat{q}_{start} \\to -\\hat{q}_{target}$ takes the long path to reach the target orientation. It can be explained by the fact that a negative rotation around the inverted rotation axis yields the same orientation as a positive orientation around the normal rotation axis, i.e. $\\theta \\tilde{r} = (-\\theta)(-\\tilde{r})$, which means that the quaternions $\\hat{q}_{target}$ and $-\\hat{q}_{target}$ lie on different hemispheres on the hypersphere surface $\\mathcal{S}^3.$ This property is unique to unit quaternions and can be leveraged in robotic motion planning for more complex and dexterous motions.\n",

These rotations take part around the basis axes of the apparent coordinate system X, Y, Z. They are a minimal representation as they only require three parameters to define a rotation. All three parameter representations of $\\mathcal{SO}(3)$ are proven to suffer from the well known gimbal lock singularity <cite id=\"107qq\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C16222978%2FTPTTZSUA\">(Stuelpnagel, 1964)</a></cite>.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Axis Angle</strong>: Construction of Rotation matrices with the <i>Rodriguez Formula</i> are similar to quaternions in the way that they are described as axis angle rotation. They are a four-parameter representation and do not suffer from gimbal lock. However, in contrary to quaternions, they do not have the antipodal property, thus lack the extra information content of directionality quaternions provide.

The loss of a degree of freedom in the rotation can be observed by setting the pitch angle close to $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi$. To give more insight into the singularity problems that arise from the computation with Euler angles, we do the inverse operation to retrieve the Euler angles back from the rotation matrix $R(\\hat{q}_{RPY})$, and do the same to retrieve the axis angle information $\\vec{w} = \\log(\\hat{q}_{RPY})$.

Application of quaternion would later require conversion of the quaternion to Euler angles. This is to enable quaternion to be compatible with other applications which use Euler rotation sequence to represent rotation. Thus, a framework to convert a quaternion, which is produced from a random rotation sequence to Euler angles with any specified rotation sequence is proposed and demonstrated here, to aid practitioners to use quaternion in their applications. This will also enable quaternion to be applied in arbitrary sequence onto applications developed using certain rotation sequence of Euler angles. Finally, a program is developed using Matlab-simulink software to demonstrate application of quaternion in maneuvering orientation of a missile flying in 3D space. Six degree of freedom (6DoF) block, which employs Euler rotation sequence of XYZ, is used to aid users to graphically see the maneuvering of the missile’s orientation as it flies in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Quaternion, which is produced from random rotation sequence keyed in by the user, is converted to Euler angles with rotation sequence XYZ by using the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Modern approaches for robot kinematics employ the product of exponentials formulation, represented using homogeneous transformation matrices. Quaternions over dual numbers are an established alternative representation; however, their use presents certain challenges: the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm contain a zero-angle singularity, and many common operations are less efficient using dual quaternions than with matrices. We present a new derivation of the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm that removes the singularity, we show an implicit representation of dual quaternions offers analytical and empirical efficiency advantages compared with both matrices and explicit dual quaternions, and we derive efficient dual quaternion forms of differential and inverse position kinematics. Analytically, implicit dual quaternions are more compact and require fewer arithmetic instructions for common operations, including chaining and exponentials. Empirically, we demonstrate a 30–40% speedup on forward kinematics and a 300–500% speedup on inverse position kinematics. This work relates dual quaternions with modern exponential coordinates and demonstrates that dual quaternions are a robust and efficient representation for robot kinematics.",

      "abstract": "The cooperation of several mobile and stationary robots in consensus is considered as one of the most important enablers for efficient, agile, and freely networked assembly systems. In this sense, the dynamic transformation of production lines requires especial modelling and control strategies for robotic manipulators, in order to provide them with reliable and feasible motions that are efficiently optimal. Therefore, the essential differences of the systems' models should be considered individually when planning their motions. At the same time, the modelling of the system should provide the control systems with an intuitive and unambiguous framework to guide them optimally through the planned motion.In the present work, optimal modelling strategies for multibody systems with tree-topology, of which open-chain robotic manipulators can be considered as a subcategory, are discussed and developed. The optimality of a modelling strategy is understood as computational efficiency, singularity-free representation, and compactness. To this end, a unit dual quaternionic representation of the system's configuration is presented and comprehensively discussed. Based on this representation, the geometry, kinetostatics, and dynamics of the multibody systems with tree-topology are developed. In order to facilitate the modelling and achieve an intuitive formulation, the geometric framework of screw theory is discussed on the analytical basis of Lie theory. This foundation can be employed to model control strategies that fulfil the premises of reliable and efficient motion control.In order to enable efficient motion planning for open-chain robotic manipulators, the essential differences between the cardinalities of their configuration manifold and their work space are considered, leading to the construction of a data structure in the form of a graph, dubbed Kinematic Graph. Using this graph, it is possible to efficiently apply the well-developed motion planning Algorithms, such as the sampling-based motion planning Algorithm, in the case study of robotic manipulators with open chains. These Algorithms were originally developed for low dimensional problems and are generally not suitable for the case study of robotic manipulators. Such Algorithms allow the application of planning strategies with theoretical optimality guarantees in the planning. This leads to the planning of an efficiently optimal motion for open-chain robotic manipulators with decoupled geometry, where the planning for the regional and the local structures should be conducted in conjunction with each other. Developments already exist for these optimal Algorithms to solve problems where conditions (such as the environment) are subject to change. The enabled application of these Algorithms to robotic manipulators makes it possible to plan motion for such systems in dynamic situations.",

      "abstract": "Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.",

In details Newton Euler equations are re-written in terms of quaternions due to the singularities that the Euler angles lead. This formulation not only avoids the gimbal lock but also allows a better performance in numerical implementation thanks to the linearity of quaternion algebra. This kind of analysis, proved by some numerical results presented, has a great importance due to the applicability of quaternion to drone control. Indeed, this latter requires a time response as quick as possible, in order to be reliable.",
